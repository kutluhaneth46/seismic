# Cryptography

This page describes the cryptographic primitives and key material underlying Seismic transactions. It targets readers who want enough detail to audit, port, or build alternative implementations — the encryption scheme, KDF, AEAD, and AAD binding are all named explicitly.

## Network keys

* The network is bootstrapped with a chain-wide **`root_key`** (32 random bytes) which validators keep secret
  * Enclave can boot in either `--genesis-node` or `--peers <ip>` mode. The former generates its own root key and shares it with peers after they pass validation. The latter loops through its peer IPs until it receives the root key from one of them
* All other network-shared keys are derived from `root_key` via HKDF-SHA256, with a purpose label for domain separation. For example, the **`tx_io`** key (the ECIES recipient for transaction encryption) is derived as `HKDF(root_key, salt=None, info="tx_io key", length=32)`
* The key clients care about is **`tx_io`** — the secp256k1 keypair used as the ECIES recipient for transaction calldata. Clients fetch the `tx_io_pk` via the [`seismic_getTeePublicKey`](../rpc-methods/seismic-get-tee-public-key.md) RPC once and cache it for subsequent transactions.

## Client keys

For each transaction the client uses a secp256k1 encryption keypair to encrypt calldata to `tx_io_pk`. The client's encryption public key is sent on-chain as part of `TxSeismicMetadata`. A client's key strategy is two independent choices:

### Axis 1 — Rotation frequency

* **Per-tx (ephemeral)** — fresh keypair per tx, discarded after submission. Each tx has its own AES key, so the `encryptionNonce` can be a fixed constant (the reference clients use all-zeros). Strongest forward deniability — the client itself cannot recover past plaintext once the key is discarded. No offline self-decryption: wallets wanting to view tx history must cache the key per tx
* **Long-lived (per-session or longer)** — same keypair reused across many txs. The `encryptionNonce` **must** be unique per tx under this key (incrementing counter or random 12-byte value; birthday-bound at ~2⁴⁸ random nonces) — same AES key + same nonce breaks AES-GCM. Enables offline self-decryption: the client recomputes `K` once and decrypts any past tx

### Axis 2 — Key source

* **Random (CSPRNG)** — `client_sk = OsRng(32)`. The key must be persisted out-of-band to reuse it; lost key = lost access
* **Derived from signing key (direct)** — `client_sk = HKDF(signing_sk, info)`. Requires the dApp/SDK to have raw access to `signing_sk` (mnemonic-based JS wallets, server-side signers, programmatic test setups). No extra backup needed beyond the wallet seed; forward deniability is lost — signing-key compromise exposes the encryption key
* **Derived from a wallet signature** — for wallets that hide `signing_sk` (MetaMask, Ledger, Trezor, Fireblocks, KMS, etc.): ask the wallet to sign a fixed message and use the signature (or `SHA-256(signature)`) as the seed. RFC 6979-deterministic ECDSA makes re-signing reproducible. The signature must be kept secret — sharing it reveals every derived encryption key

### Common combinations

* **Ephemeral × random** — recommended default, used by the seismic-viem and seismic_web3 reference clients. Privacy-maxing; no self-decryption without explicit per-tx caching
* **Ephemeral × derived (direct)** — fresh keypair per tx, deterministically derived from `signing_sk`. Combines "no separate backup" with "fresh K per tx (no nonce-reuse concern)." Suitable when the dApp has direct access to `signing_sk`
* **Long-lived × random** — single CSPRNG key reused. Enables offline self-decryption; the encryption key must be backed up separately from the wallet seed
* **Long-lived × signature-derived** — single key derived from one wallet signature at session start. **Used by the [Fireblocks SDK](https://github.com/fireblocks/seismic-sdk)**: signs a fixed seed via Fireblocks RAW signing, hashes the signature into a session-scoped encryption key. Re-derives on session restart without user re-approval (MPC signatures are deterministic); no out-of-band backup needed — the wallet covers both signing and encryption

Other combinations (e.g., per-tx × signature-derived, which would require a wallet-signature prompt per tx) are valid but operationally rare.

## Encryption scheme

Transaction calldata encryption is **ECIES on secp256k1** — a standard KEM-DEM hybrid public-key encryption construction, using the EC primitives Seismic already requires for signing.

End-to-end pipeline (client side; decryption inverts):

```
ECDH(client_sk, network_pk) ──► shared point
                              │
                              ▼  SHA256 of compressed point
                          shared_secret (32 B)
                              │
                              ▼  HKDF-SHA256, info = "aes-gcm key"
                          AES-256 key (32 B)
                              │
                              ▼  AES-GCM, 12 B nonce, AAD = RLP(TxSeismicMetadata)
                          ciphertext
```

**KEM (key encapsulation)**

* Curve: **secp256k1**
* ECDH on secp256k1: shared point = `client_sk × network_pk` (encryption side) / `network_sk × client_pk` (decryption side)
* Shared-secret derivation: `SHA256` of the SEC1 **compressed-point encoding** of the shared ECDH point — i.e., `SHA256(0x02 || x)` if the y-coordinate is even, `SHA256(0x03 || x)` if odd. This is libsecp256k1's `ecdh::SharedSecret::new(pk, sk)` default behaviour and matches the Rust [`ecies`](https://github.com/ecies/rs) crate convention; Python and TypeScript reimplementations construct the parity byte explicitly as `(shared_point.y[-1] & 0x01) | 0x02`

**KDF**

Takes the 32-byte `shared_secret` produced by the KEM step and expands it into the actual symmetric encryption key.

* Algorithm: **HKDF-SHA256**
* `ikm` (input keying material): the `shared_secret` from above
* `salt`: none — the `ikm` is already a SHA-256 output and therefore uniformly random, so Extract has no biased entropy to extract from. [RFC 5869 §3.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5869#section-3.1) explicitly permits this
* `info`: `"aes-gcm key"` — provides domain separation; lets the same `shared_secret` derive other context-specific keys in the future with a different label
* Output length: 32 bytes — the AES-256 key

**DEM (authenticated encryption)**

* **AES-256-GCM**. Requests use a 12-byte nonce supplied by the client (the `encryptionNonce` field in `TxSeismicMetadata`). Signed-read responses use a 12-byte IV drawn by the TEE per response, behind a one-byte format version (`version || iv || ciphertext || tag`, version `1`). The version byte is appended to the response AAD, so it is authenticated and cannot be altered in flight; clients reject any other value rather than falling back to an older layout — one signed read can be executed any number of times, so the client's nonce is not unique per response ciphertext
* **AAD = RLP-encoded `TxSeismicMetadata`** — the 11-field metadata struct (`sender`, `chain_id`, tx `nonce`, `to`, `value`, `encryption_pubkey`, `encryption_nonce`, `recentBlockHash`, `expires_at_block`, `signedRead`, `messageVersion`). Binding everything that contextualizes the tx prevents ciphertext malleability across senders, replay across chains or blocks, and substitution attacks

**Decryption (any validator node)**

* `tx_io_sk` (re-derived from `root_key` on demand) + client's `eph_pk` from the on-chain tx → ECDH → same shared secret → same AES key → AEAD-open with the same AAD → plaintext calldata

## Curve choice

* **secp256k1** rather than X25519 (the curve used by HPKE / RFC 9180) to avoid a curve split: the same secp256k1 stack already required for Ethereum signing handles encryption. Clients can encrypt to `tx_io_pk` using libraries they already have for signatures (libsecp256k1, ethers, viem, web3.py, etc.) — no separate X25519 dependency
* The trade-off is that we use a custom ECIES variant instead of a standardized HPKE suite. RFC 9180 defines KEMs for X25519/X448/P-256/P-384/P-521 but not secp256k1, so adopting HPKE would have required switching curves

## Reference implementations

All implementations produce byte-identical ciphertexts for the same inputs on the request path. Signed-read response encryption draws a fresh IV per call, so it is deterministic only given that IV: cross-implementation checks on the response path must decrypt to a known plaintext rather than compare ciphertext bytes.

* **Rust (ECIES primitive):** [`enclave/crates/enclave/src/crypto.rs`](https://github.com/SeismicSystems/enclave/tree/seismic/crates/enclave/src/crypto.rs) in the [`seismic-enclave`](https://github.com/SeismicSystems/enclave) crate. This is the source-of-truth Rust implementation, used by both the client side (via `seismic-alloy`) and the server side (via `seismic-enclave-server`)
* **Rust (TxSeismic wire format + tx construction):** [`seismic-alloy/crates/consensus`](https://github.com/SeismicSystems/seismic-alloy/tree/seismic/crates/consensus) — depends on `seismic-enclave` for the ECIES math
* **Python:** [`clients/py/src/seismic_web3/crypto/ecdh.py`](https://github.com/SeismicSystems/seismic/tree/main/clients/py/src/seismic_web3/crypto/ecdh.py) — independent reimplementation; matches the Rust shared-secret derivation by construction
* **TypeScript:** [`clients/ts/`](https://github.com/SeismicSystems/seismic/tree/main/clients/ts) — independent reimplementation
