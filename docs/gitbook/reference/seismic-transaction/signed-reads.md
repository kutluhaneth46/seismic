# Signed Reads

A signed read is a Seismic transaction (type `0x4a`) sent to `eth_call` instead of `eth_sendRawTransaction`. It lets contracts authenticate the reader's `msg.sender` for read-only queries — e.g., "only the owner can view their balance."

## Why signed reads exist

In the EVM, anyone can set the `from` field of an `eth_call` to spoof any address. Seismic closes this in two parts:

1. Vanilla `eth_call` has its `from` field **zeroed out** by the node — `msg.sender == 0` inside contract code
2. A signed read is a Seismic tx where the validator recovers the signer from the signature and uses *that* address as `msg.sender`

## How signed reads differ from write txs

A signed read is built exactly like a write tx (same `SeismicElements`, same encryption flow — see [Tx Lifecycle](tx-lifecycle.md) and [Cryptography](cryptography.md)). The differences are:

* **Sent to `eth_call`**, not `eth_sendRawTransaction`. Either a raw tx or an EIP-712 envelope (`message_version = 2`)
* The **`signed_read`** field should be set to `true` (default in our clients). The tx-pool rejects `signed_read = true` at write submission, so an intercepted signed read can't be replayed as a write tx
* The validator decrypts the calldata, runs the call inside the EVM, and returns the result **encrypted to the client's `encryption_pubkey`** — an on-path interceptor can't read the response either. The validator draws a fresh IV for each response and prepends it behind a one-byte format version, so the response is `version || iv || ciphertext || tag`. Because a signed read can be executed repeatedly (at any block height the caller picks), reusing the client's `encryption_nonce` here would put two responses under one AES-GCM `(key, nonce)` pair
* Signed simulations, including signed `eth_call` and `eth_estimateGas` requests, require `signed_read = true`. For gas estimation, clients build a separate signed-read twin of the write with fresh encryption metadata, simulate that request, and then sign the final write with `signed_read = false`. This keeps the estimate non-broadcastable and avoids reusing an AES-GCM nonce between the simulation and the write
